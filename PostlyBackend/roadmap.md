Here's a detailed roadmap and feature sheet for Postly Falcon API, incorporating security, user control, and insight-driven ranking.

# **Postly Falcon API - Feature Sheet & Roadmap**  

## **1. Authentication Security Infrastructure**  

### **Tier 1: Base Auth Level (Limited Access)**
- **Read-Only Access**: 900 AI concurrent reads.
- **Who is in Tier 1?**  
  1. **Unverified bots** - Users or bots that have not been verified.  
  2. **Exceeded Tier 2 constraints** - Users who have exceeded the limits of Tier 2 (e.g., excessive reads).  

### **Tier 2: Intermediate Auth Level (Standard User)**
- **Base Read/Write Access**  
  - **200 reads per 35-minute window** (Exceeding this results in demotion to Tier 1).  
  - **15 write periods per 2-hour window** (Exceeding this results in temporary write lock for 2-5 minutes).  

### **Tier 3: High Security Level (Privileged Access)**
- **Access to advanced system insights**  
- **Bypasses Tier 2 restrictions**  
- **Has access to AI training results & AI endpoints**  
- **Exclusive to engineers & administrators**

## **2. Insight Algorithm (AI-Driven Content Ranking & Control)**  

### **Current Issue**
- Previous Postly backend lacked user-defined ranking and was difficult to debug.  

### **Solution: AI-Driven Dynamic Ranking**
- User interactions (e.g., post visits, likes, time spent on content) **dynamically influence ranking**.  
- AI ranks and demotes content based on credibility & urgency.  
- **Priority Content Categories**:  
  - **High Officials & Verified News Sources**  
  - **Missing Persons / Amber Alerts**  
  - **Urgent Information (e.g., Emergency Broadcasts)**  

### **User Control & Customization**
- Users can **opt out** of tracking features, including:  
  1. Time spent scrolling.  
  2. Time spent viewing posts.  
  3. Daily & comment section scroll activity.  
  4. Visit frequency to specific creators.  
  5. AI-based post prediction based on engagement patterns.

## **3. Privacy & User Control (Transparency-Focused Design)**  
- **No shadow bans**: Instead, AI ranks posts transparently based on insights.  
- **Explicit content filtering**: Users can define what content they want to see or avoid.  
- **Manual algorithm override**: Users can adjust content ranking preferences (e.g., prioritize friends, news, or entertainment).  
- **Customizable data retention policies**: Users control how long their activity is stored.  

---

## **4. Security & Infrastructure**  
- **End-to-End Encryption**: For all messages, posts, and interactions.  
- **Decentralized Backup System**: Ensuring user data is protected against outages.  
- **Bot & Spam Prevention**:  
  - Anomaly detection via activity trends.  
  - Real-time AI monitoring for abuse patterns.  
- **Multi-Layer Authentication**:  
  - Password + 2FA (Authenticator app or hardware key).  
  - OAuth-based login for verified services.  

---

## **5. Monetization & Sustainability**  
- **No traditional ads**: Revenue comes from privacy-friendly methods such as:  
  - **Subscription tiers** (e.g., extra storage, customization options).  
  - **Crowdsourced funding & sponsorships**.  
  - **Secure API access for businesses**.  

---

## **6. API & Developer Access**  
- **Secure OAuth API Access** (For apps and third-party integrations).  
- **AI API for Content Insights** (Businesses can utilize insights ethically).  
- **Rate-Limited Developer Tokens** to prevent abuse.
