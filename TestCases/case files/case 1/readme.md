# Test Case case file 1 pre reqs

## Overview
Describe the purpose of this test case, its scope, and why it is necessary. Explain how it fits into the overall testing strategy.
Case 1 is a http endpoint test, this case focuses on authentication checking, post listing and speed.
It does exentisve error handling and ensuring that we do not publish broken authentication code.

## Test Case Purpose
- **Why this is a test case:**
    Often times code can break things, and its up to us to ensure we dont ship
    bad code. We do not want any problems with users being able to login so we test our endpoints to ensure things have not broken by a single altercation! 

    Sometimes database changes can break things, and sometimes fields are not defined, we should test to ensure that the fields are populated.  

## Test Execution Instructions
1. **Setup:**  
     List any prerequisites, environment setup, or data required.
     OS: Ideally ran on linux, but windows works aswell
     Bun Version: Please make sure you are running the up-to-date version, you will have to include this in your dev test audit sheet. 
2. **Steps to Execute:**  
     Ensure latest version of bun is installed `bun upgrade`
     Ensure login credentials are passed into .env  

3. **Expected Results:**  
     Expect Authentication Test 1 to return test_successfully of value true.
     Expect Fetch Post Flow - to authenticate properly, fetch works, and the resolved request data is defined. It also ensures it contains post content and the author is defined.

## Test Completion Criteria
- **How to write off:**  
    A successfully test, is when all satisfied expectations are deemed pass and all test modules are passed. 0 failure

## Reporting
- Each developer must report test results to: _[Your Name or Contact Info]_
- All tests must pass the following requirements:
    1. **Time Taken Requirement:**  
         Specify the maximum allowable time for test completion.
    2. **Physical Error Checking Requirement:**  
         Detail any manual or automated checks for physical errors.
    3. **Reproducible User Errors:**  
         List known user errors that should be reproducible and how to document them.
